Changes for EPublisher::Source::Plugin::MetaCPAN
================================================

0.18 2012-06-13
    - removing regex which made problems (github issue 18)

0.17 2012-05-10
    - add possibility to just return one single module

0.16 2012-05-03
    - MetaCPAN encodes the response in utf-8, within EPublisher everything should
      be in Perl's internal format, so we have to decode the Pod source

0.15 2012-04-26
    - MetaCPAN does not handle ".pm" in release names, so we have to remove it

0.14 2012-04-14
    - do not croak on errors, skip the files instead

0.13 2012-04-14
    - add more debugging code

0.12 2012-04-12
    - some modules have different versions in main module and dist name
      so we have to use an other field from MetaCPAN API

0.11 2012-04-02
    - fixed a bug in POD detection. (POD without "=head" is ignored)
    - take possible comments in MANIFEST into account
    - tweaked Regex for finding POD (looking everywhere but example/ and t/)

0.1  2012-03-19
    - initial release
